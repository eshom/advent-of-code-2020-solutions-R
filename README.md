# Advent of Code 2020 Solutions (R)
These are my solutions to the 2020 Advent of Code.
All of my solutions were completed using the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org).

Each directory includes at least two files: *code.R* and *input.txt*.
The first is the R code, and the latter is my instance of the Advent of Code input.
Sometimes I include an *input-eg.txt* file, which is a smaller example input
(copied from the challenge instructions) to test out solutions before running
on the full, larger input file.
